# access_control_with_azure_and_esp01


 In this project we´ll use the azure face api to identify faces in a live video, that´s comming from a security camera over a front door. The face recognition code will work with Arduino ESP-01, that is controlling a door´s lock, to grant or deny access based on the models we trainned, when comparing it with the image captured by a IPcam. We´ll also export the results to the cloud and start the data engineering process with the data generated by the script, the final architeture will be something like this.

The explanation part for code related to the azure face recognition you can find in the video_face_recognition repo, so please check out the video_face_recognition repo before this one. 

So I´ll start explaining how we can move the data to azure and then how we can set up the Arduino to control the lock.

## move data to blob storage
Now I´m going to explain how we can move the data we´re creating to a blob storage. I´ll create a new file for it.

We´ll  need these values to our key.json to use as credentials to connect to our blob storage.

```Python
storage_account_key = credential['storage_account_key']
storage_account_name = credential['storage_account_name']
connection_string = credential['connection_string']
container_name = credential['container_name']
```
And we´ll need another function to create the blob

```Python
def uploadToBlobStorage(file_path,file_name)
   blob_service_client = BlobServiceClient.from_connection_string(connection_string)
   blob_client = blob_service_client.get_blob_client(container=container_name, blob=file_name)
   with open(file_path,'rb') as data:
      blob_client.upload_blob(data)
      print('Uploaded {}.'.format(file_name))
```

Inside our code´s loop we´ll need to create two variables that we´ll use to create a folder for each day in the blob storage and another one to create the file name

```Python
    while True:
        folder_date = datetime.now().date().strftime('%Y%m%d')
        filename_date = datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d_%H%M%S')
```

Then for each face we´ll append a timestamp value, the bottomSize a location, we´ll save the file locally and then call the function to send the file to our blob

```Python
  # Gerando o arquivo com as informações captadas pelo video
  faces = [{**face, 'timeStamp': str(datetime.now()), 'bottomSize': str(bottom), 'location': 'Casa'} for face in faces]
  json_string = json.dumps(faces, separators=(',', ':'))

  with open('output\mydata-{}.json'.format(filename_date), 'w') as f:
            json.dump(json.JSONDecoder().decode(json_string), f)
            
  # Calling a function to perform upload
  uploadToBlobStorage('output\mydata-{}.json'.format(filename_date),'{}/mydata-{}.json'.format(folder_date,filename_date))
```
This is how the data should be in our storage

## set up the ESP-01

Work with Arduino can be very gratifying, when our first led start blynking it´s awesome. I found this link that is explaining how to set the ESP-01 step by step the same way I did it. 

https://www.blogdarobotica.com/2020/09/18/programando-o-esp01-utilizando-o-adaptador-usb-serial-para-esp8266-esp-01/

The ESP-01 code is very simple, it works like a web server, that´s expecting a call, and depending on the value received, it will send or not an event to our door lock.

first we start with the imports and the definitions

```C++
#include <ESP8266WiFi.h>

#ifndef STASSID
#define STASSID "*****"
#define STAPSK "******"
#endif

const char* ssid = STASSID;
const char* password = STAPSK;
```

with this we start the server
```C++
WiFiServer server(80);
```

Here we´ll set the gpio0 and 2 as outputs and set the initial state as LOW,
```C++
void setup() {
  delay(5000);
  pinMode(0, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(2, OUTPUT);
  digitalWrite(0, LOW);
  digitalWrite(2, LOW);
  // Serial.begin(9600);
  // Serial.print("Connecting to ");
  // Serial.println(ssid);
```
Then we can set the wifi mode as station and begin the connection
```C++
  WiFi.mode(WIFI_STA);

  WiFi.begin(ssid,password);

  while (WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED){
    delay(500);
    // Serial.print(".");
  }

  // Serial.println("ESP-01 is connected to the ssid");
  // Serial.println(WiFi.localIP());
  server.begin();
  delay(1000);
}
```
On the loop we expecting to receive an request like this 'http://192.168.0.1/open' to open the lock. So we´ll parse our result to check if we have the 'open' at the end, and if so, we´ll change the value of the pins to HIGH, openning the lock

```C++
void loop() {
  WiFiClient client;
  client = server.available();

  if (client == 1){
    String request = client.readStringUntil('\n');
    client.flush();
    // Serial.println(request);

    if (request.indexOf("open") != -1){
      digitalWrite(0, HIGH);
      delay(5000);
      digitalWrite(0, LOW);
      delay(1000);
      digitalWrite(2, HIGH);
      delay(5000);
      digitalWrite(2, LOW);
      // Serial.println("Openning door");
    }
    // Serial.print("Client Disconnected");
    // Serial.println(" ");
  }
}

```
After seting up the ESP, you can upload this sketch to the ESP-01, but with a little modification. 

I leave some lines commented, because we won´t need the serial output while running in production, but we´ll need it to get the ESP-01 IP to stabilish the communication between the ESP and our Python code. So before upload the first time, uncomment the lines, plug the ESP in the USB port, open the serial monitor and get the ESP-01 IP

![image](https://github.com/ricauduro/access_control_face_reco_and_arduino/assets/58055908/8ec8edf7-1b2a-493a-99cb-92b4435a0be9)

Th Python code that we need to add to the face_recogniton code is very simple. Just send a request to the IP we got from the ESP-01, with '/open' at the end.

```python
import urllib.request

root_url = "http://192.168.0.176"

def sendRequest(url):
	urllib.request.urlopen(url) # send request to ESP

sendRequest(root_url+"/open")
```

The sendRequest we can insert into a IF conditon, to guarantee that the door will open when we get real close to it, and only if it recognize our faces.

```python
if bottom > 250 and nome != 'Desconhecido':
                sendRequest(root_url+"/open")
```
