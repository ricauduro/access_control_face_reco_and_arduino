# access_control_with_azure_face_reco_and_arduino


 In this project we´ll use the azure face api to identify faces in a live video, that´s comming from a security camera in front of a door. The face recognition code will work with Arduino, that is controlling a door´s lock, to grant or deny access based on the models we trainned, when comparing it with the image captured by a IPcam. We´ll also export the results to the cloud and start the data engineering process with the data generated by the script, the final architeture will be something like this.
